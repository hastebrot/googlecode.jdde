DMLERR_ADVACKTIMEOUT=A request for a synchronous advise transaction has timed out.
DMLERR_BUSY=The response to the transaction caused the DDE_FBUSY flag to be set.
DMLERR_DATAACKTIMEOUT=A request for a synchronous data transaction has timed out.
DMLERR_DLL_NOT_INITIALIZED=A DDEML function was called without first calling the DdeInitialize function, or an invalid instance identifier was passed to a DDEML function.
DMLERR_DLL_USAGE=An application initialized as APPCLASS_MONITOR has attempted to perform a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) transaction, or an application initialized as APPCMD_CLIENTONLY has attempted to perform server transactions.
DMLERR_EXECACKTIMEOUT=A request for a synchronous execute transaction has timed out.
DMLERR_INVALIDPARAMETER=A parameter failed to be validated by the DDEML.

#Some of the possible causes follow:
#The application used a data handle initialized with a different item name handle than was required by the transaction.
#The application used a data handle that was initialized with a different clipboard data format than was required by the transaction.
#The application used a client-side conversation handle with a server-side function or vice versa.
#The application used a freed data handle or string handle.
#More than one instance of the application used the same object.

DMLERR_LOW_MEMORY=A DDEML application has created a prolonged race condition (in which the server application outruns the client), causing large amounts of memory to be consumed.
DMLERR_MEMORY_ERROR=A memory allocation has failed.
DMLERR_NO_CONV_ESTABLISHED=A client's attempt to establish a conversation has failed.
DMLERR_NOTPROCESSED=A transaction has failed.
DMLERR_POKEACKTIMEOUT=A request for a synchronous poke transaction has timed out.
DMLERR_POSTMSG_FAILED=An internal call to the PostMessage function has failed.
DMLERR_REENTRANCY=An application instance with a synchronous transaction already in progress attempted to initiate another synchronous transaction, or the DdeEnableCallback function was called from within a DDEML callback function.
DMLERR_SERVER_DIED=A server-side transaction was attempted on a conversation terminated by the client, or the server terminated before completing a transaction.
DMLERR_SYS_ERROR=An internal error has occurred in the DDEML.
DMLERR_UNADVACKTIMEOUT=A request to end an advise transaction has timed out.
DMLERR_UNFOUND_QUEUE_ID=An invalid transaction identifier was passed to a DDEML function. Once the application has returned from an XTYP_XACT_COMPLETE callback, the transaction identifier for that callback function is no longer valid.
